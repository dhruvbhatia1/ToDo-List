# To-Do List

Created a To-do list website using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, allowing users to create and manage their own To-do lists, add new items, mark items as complete, edit the title of the To-do list or delete the entire list. 
The website is responsive and implements server-side logic using Express, and stores data in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
